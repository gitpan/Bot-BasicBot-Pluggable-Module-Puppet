NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Puppet - Ventriloquy via POE-flavored
    YAML over TCP

DESCRIPTION
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Puppet enables talking in channels as
    the bot by sending commands to it over a TCP socket.

SYNOPSIS
    You will need to load the module into your instance:

     $bot->load('Puppet');

    The bot will listen on the address and port specified in the store via
    the keys "addr" and "port". If not specified, the bind address and port
    will default to 127.0.0.1 and 28800, respectively.

METHODS
    init
        This method is an initialization method called by the constructor
        inherited from Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module. The plugin object
        itself is instantiated by the load method in
        Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable.

        The initialization comprises the entire functionality of this
        plugin. The real work is done by the POE pieces and the ClientInput
        callback.

        We instantiate a new POE::Component::Server::TCP object that
        utilizes a YAML serializer via POE::Filter::Reference. The TCP
        server expects to receive a hashref that is passed directly to the
        bot's say method.

BUGS
    This plugin offers absolutely no access control, so be aware of
    how/where you deploy it.
